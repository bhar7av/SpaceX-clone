SpaceX-clone
🚀 Project Overview

This is a responsive, modern web clone of the SpaceX homepage, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to practise front-end skills, mimic a real-world brand layout, and showcase animations, layout techniques and responsiveness.

🎯 Features

Fully responsive layout: adapts seamlessly from mobile to desktop.

Clean header/navigation and hero section inspired by the SpaceX site.

Multiple page structure (index + variant pages: e.g., falcon9, falcon-heavy, dragon).

Custom CSS styling (including flexbox/grid) and subtle hover/scroll animations.

JavaScript enhancements for interactive elements (e.g., smooth scroll, menu toggling).

Organized folder/file structure:
├ index.html  
├ falcon9.html  
├ falcon-heavy.html  
├ dragon.html  
├ style.css  
├ script.js  
└ …  


🧰 Tech Stack

HTML5 – semantic markup

CSS3 – layout (Flexbox / Grid), transitions, responsive breakpoints

JavaScript (ES6+) – simple interactivity and DOM manipulation

📝 Getting Started
Prerequisites

No backend or database required — just a browser!

Installation / Run

Clone the repository:
ON gitbash

git clone https://github.com/bhar7av/SpaceX-clone.git  


Open the project folder and launch index.html in your preferred browser.

(Optional) Use a live-server extension or lightweight HTTP server to serve locally for better behaviour of some features.

🧩 Project Structure

index.html — main page

Additional pages: falcon9.html, falcon-heavy.html, dragon.html — each styled to match the theme.

style.css — styles for layout, typography, responsiveness, animations.

script.js — JavaScript for menu toggling, scroll events, animations as needed.

Assets (if any) — images, icons, fonts.

✅ Why This Project Rocks

Great for showcasing front-end skills in a portfolio or resume.

Demonstrates ability to replicate professional-looking UI from a major brand.

Shows command over responsive design, animation, clean code structure.

Lightweight and easy to deploy (just static files) — good for hosting on GitHub Pages or Netlify.

🚧 What’s Next / Potential Enhancements

Convert static pages into a single-page React or Vue application for smoother routing and state handling.

Add a CSS-preprocessor (Sass / LESS) to improve styling maintainability.

Integrate API data (e.g., live rocket launch information from SpaceX’s public API) to bring dynamic content.

Add more animations, lazy loading for images, performance optimizations.

Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation) and cross-browser testing.
